# Sample Mexican Restaurant Page - Hola Fresca
This is a sample Mexican Restaurant called Hola Fresca that was made using a template from templatemo.com. It features five different pages: a home page, a menu, a contact form, an order form, and a reviews page. Besides the HTML used to structure the web pages, it features CSS styling, Javascript functionality, and some Bootstrap elements. The project was an assignment that involved using varied colors and imagery to mimic the look and feel of an actual restaurant's website.

All pages utilize Bootstrap icons for the social media links in the header and footer sections and feature a contact section ahead of the footer. 

## Home Page 
The main page of the website provides an overview of the restaurant. It is split into 7 sections: 
  * An image slider featuring various images of the location and food items
  * A welcome section that provides additional links to the other pages with icons
  * A background of the restaurant with information on the owner and Hola Fresca's mission
  * A menu preview with 3 of the menu items
  * A form that allows for users to submit a resume and apply for the restaurant
  * A news section with two sample news stories
  * A reviews section with four sample reviews that prompts users to write a review

The image slider uses JavaScript to automatically cycle through the images on a timer and also has buttons that fade in when moused over to manually cycle the images. The welcome section has images that shrink and are highlighted in red when moused over due to CSS. The owner blurb also features similar Bootstrap icons as the footer/header; they change to red and black when moused over. The menu previews also change colors on their links to the menu page. The hiring form has a button that allows users to upload files from their computer and has a submit button at the bottom that changes colors as well. The reviews section has a cycle that rotates between the various reviews and pops out the reviewer when their review shows; the reviewers are faded out otherwise.
